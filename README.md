# RCRPG
A ridiculously complex rpg in the making

This code will hopefully provide a system that will eventually run a very complicated, automated RPG
and Guild Master sim.

Dev Log
It doesn't do much, right now. 
-You can randomize the stats of a player and monster.
-Secondary Stats are shown in separate frames
-An automated fight simulator is in the works.
